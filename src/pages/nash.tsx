              when we first started talking.
              it was mad exciting.
              it was exciting because i could feel it coming.
              i began noticing how you spoke to me.
              and when you chose to speak to me.
              it was different.
              our energy was rare, and i think you felt it too.

              with previous relationships, i always noticed that, if i was being honest with chvn®, I knew it wasnt it,
              they didn't inspire me, push me, or even make me feel.
